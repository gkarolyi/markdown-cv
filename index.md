## Experience

Melbourne, Australia.

The Digital Project creates custom project, workforce, and investment management software for every industry, used to run some of the largest projects in Australia.

Working with TDP on a contract basis, I built a timesheet approval system and planned and created a 'roadmap' project overview feature, both of which are in use by clients to manage thousands of tasks and resources. As a contractor, I managed my own milestones and targets, ensuring that I was able to deliver quality features on time. As an outsider I was also able to identify and implement refactorings and tech upgrades that significantly sped up the development process itself.

*Stack*: TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Microsoft PowerApps

`April 2022-August 2022`
**Software Developer**, *[GapFish](https://www.gapfish.com/)*<br>
Berlin, Germany.

Following just under a year of collaborating with and learning from the rest of the GapFish team, I was very proud to lose my 'junior' title and be promoted early to Software Developer after a very favourable performance review. As part of the team responsible for bridging the gap between GapFish tech and our new parent company Cint, I worked alongside our CTO and our most senior developer to architect and create a new integrated system, laying the foundations for a process of gradual consolidation of two large, partly legacy codebases despite the different tech stacks and approaches.

GapFish is a Berlin-based provider of online market research, part of Cint, the technology backbone of the world’s most successful insights companies.

Working alongside a team of highly experienced Ruby on Rails developers in a team focused on clean code, CI/CD and quality over quantity, I was able to grow and improve quickly. Early on, I took a leading role in improving our payout risk assessment flow on the backend, then successfully delivered a custom panel for a a large, important German client, coordinating with other developers on my team as well as stakeholders at GapFish and our customer.

*Stack*: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Stimulus, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

Mentoring and pairing with students, helping them with daily challenges on Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
After finishing the intensive Web Development bootcamp at Le Wagon Berlin, I applied and was selected to work alongside my former teachers as a Teaching Assistant. I worked with students one on one and in small groups to solve the daily challenges and help them understand the lectures and course material, and received great feedback highlighting my patience, knowledge, and friendly attitude.

*Stack*: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

`June 2020-December 2020`
**Content Moderator**, *[Majorel](https://www.majorel.com/)*<br>
Berlin, Germany.

Majorel is a global leader in customer experience, working with many of the world’s most respected digital-native and vertical leading brands.

While completing my Masters thesis on sentiment analysis I also worked full time as a social media content moderator for the Danish and global (English) markets. The role entailed keeping up to date with ever changing policy guidelines, making hundreds of potentially significant moderation decisions each day.

`April 2018-August 2018`
**Delivery Manager**, *[Aparito](https://www.aparito.com/)*<br>
Berlin, Germany.

Following a favourable annual review, I was proud to be promoted to Delivery Manager and take on a range of new responsibilities. As Delivery Manager I oversaw the delivery of Agile software development projects, working with customers and developers to analyse and communicate technical requirements, performing project planning and resource allocation tasks, and coordinating the efforts of our team to ensure timely delivery in accordance with strictly regulated GxP processes.

`January 2018-April 2018`
**Community Manager**, *[Aparito](https://www.aparito.com/)*<br>
Berlin, Germany.

Aparito digitises clinical trials and unlocks real-world data through mobile apps, video assessments, and wearable devices in order to streamline the drug development process especially for orphan diseases.

As Community Manager at aparito, my role was to explore opportunities for expanding the company's reach into Europe, and to act as the first point of contact facilitating dialogue between our partner Bayer, the senior management team at aparito, and potential clients or partners in Germany and Switzerland.


`November 2016-April 2017`
